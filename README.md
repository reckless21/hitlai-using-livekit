🚀 Overview

The system simulates an AI-powered salon receptionist using LiveKit, Firebase Firestore, and a React frontend.
When the AI doesn’t know an answer, it:

Escalates the query to a human supervisor.

Logs a help request in Firestore.

Notifies the supervisor (via simulated webhook/console log).

Waits for a response and then automatically updates the knowledge base.

Follows up with the customer instantly once resolved.

⚙️ Tech Stack

LiveKit – Real-time voice AI simulation & call handling.

Firebase Firestore – Database for help request lifecycle & knowledge base.

React.js – Supervisor admin panel (pending/resolved requests, learned answers).

Python – Backend agent logic & LiveKit integration.

Gemini / HuggingFace / TTS – For AI response generation and speech synthesis.

🧩 Core Features

📞 AI Call Handling – Receives and responds to simulated calls.

🧑‍💼 Escalation Workflow – Creates and manages human help requests.

🧠 Knowledge Base – Learns new answers from supervisor inputs.

🪄 Supervisor Dashboard – Simple UI to view, resolve, and track requests.

🔁 Lifecycle Management – Pending → Resolved / Unresolved states.

⚡ Auto-Follow-up – AI texts or logs responses back once resolved.

🏗️ System Architecture

Agent Layer – Built using LiveKit SDK + Python.

Database Layer – Firestore collections for help_requests and knowledge_base.

UI Layer – React admin interface for supervisors.

Integration Layer – Webhooks/console logs simulate communication loops.

🧠 Design Highlights

Modular and scalable design to support future live transfer (Phase 2).

Graceful timeout handling for supervisor unresponsiveness.

Clean schema design linking help requests and customer sessions.

Separation of agent logic, DB handling, and UI for clarity and testing.
